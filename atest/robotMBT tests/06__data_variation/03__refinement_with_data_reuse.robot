Documentation     This suite focuses on data variation based on equivalence partitioning and
...               additionally uses refinement. The high-level scenario uses data from an
...               equivalence class, the same selected data must be used at the lower-level.
...               Note: In opposition to regular use, the low-level refinement scenario uses
...               contradicting example values compared to the high-level scenario. This is to
...               force this suite to fail when data variation is not applied at all.
