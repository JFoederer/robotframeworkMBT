Documentation     This suite focuses on data variation based on equivalence partitioning and
...               additionally makes use of the same equivalence class twice in the same scenario.
...               Because the example is about two distinct values, the model must also choose
...               different values for the two arguments. Note: In opposition to regular use, the
...               examples that need to be combined use contradicting examples. This is to force
...               this suite to fail when data variation is not applied at all.
