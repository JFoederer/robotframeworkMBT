Documentation     This suite uses the `seed` argument to reproduce a previously generated trace
...               and includes step modifiers. The suite passes if the recorded trace is reproduced
...               exactly as indicated by the trace string. Following the background all scenarios
...               are equally valid. Even though the content of each scenario is identical, data
...               included, the modifers will number the scenarios at random. The reproduced trace
...               must match for both the scenario order and the data order.
