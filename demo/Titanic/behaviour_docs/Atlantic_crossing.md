# Feature: Atlantic crossing

> As a Captain  
I want to cross the Atlantic without incident  
so that the safety of the crew, passengers and cargo is assured

During the crossing of the Atlantic ocean, various dangers are present, such as
adverse weather, other naval trafic and, not least of which, icebergs. Any of
these dangers can affect the seaworthyness of the ship, and thus threaten the
safety of the passengers and crew, and cause damage to cargo. Harm to the
passengers and crew, or damaged cargo, could have financial implications as the
shipping company may be held liable.

## Rule: When crossing Iceberg Alley, there shall be a lookout for icebergs

In the area of the Altantic ocean known as Iceberg Alley, icebergs may be
present. The icebergs are a shipping hazard, as they may cause damage to any
ships that hit them. Any damage to the ship may affect the ship's
seaworthyness, and could cause delays.

> The area we call “Iceberg Alley” is located about 250 miles east and southeast of the island of Newfoundland, Canada. Iceberg Alley is usually considered to be that portion of the Labrador Current, that flows southward from Flemish Pass, along the eastern edge of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, to the Tail of the Banks. This area extends approximately from 48 to 43 degrees North Latitude at 48 degrees West longitude.
